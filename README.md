## Basic Setup:

**1.1) Go to the _./necessaryData_ directory and complete all the steps listed in the _README.txt_ file.**

.

**1.2) Replace "username" and "password" in the _./scripts/instagram/__init __.py_ file with your username and your password.**

.

**1.3) Fill the _./scripts/generalUsedTools/linksOnEnemies/unparsedLinks_ file with links to instagram accounts. There is already many profiles in the file, and the text was taken from this [telegram channel](https://t.me/stoprussiachannel).** 
*That's why the file is named "unparsedLinks": you can leave there any text with links and the script will select only links from the all other junk.*

.

### Now the program can be run.

## Text Files:

**1. unparsedLinks is the file with all the text/links you want the scpirt to work on.**
**2. allParsedLinks.txt extracted links from all the junk from the previous step.**
**3. reportedOnesInst.txt is the file with all the instagram account that have been already reported.**

.

***ALGORITHM STEPS ON HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS you can see in the terminal output when you run the script.***

*This project was supposed to be multi social media reporting application, not only for Instagram, but for Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and Facebook as well. That's exactly why ./scripts folder is divided on "generalUsedTools" and "instagram" packages, there were supposed to be packages for all the other social media. That's the first version of the project.*
